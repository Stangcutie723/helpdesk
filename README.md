App Overview:<br>
User is supposed to be able to have email sending and recieving through an existing application. 
The user would be able to submit a ticket and get responses. For this I simply created a new 
application. Unfortunately I was unable to get as far as I did in the email_exercise repo which
was my learning repo regarding these new skills. I troubleshooted for 5 hours and gained a headache
so I will come back to it tomorrow after I sleep.
